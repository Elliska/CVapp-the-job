CVapp the job 

Why even creating an app? Because it was my dream for a very long time to make an app. I was even drawing my own platform games in elementary school but was never able to make one! Main goal of this app is to learn python and working with databases (data pipelines, transformations, database architecture).

This project is made to make my life easier and save myself a lot of tedious manual work when looking for a job and to have better feedback and understanding of my applying strategy and companies’s hiring strategy.

I do like databases and for some time it was enough to just write couple lines of where and when did I apply for a job in excel. Later on I needed more. The frontend part of this project is not my goal, but it is necessary. I have never built an app before, so this poses a whole new set of challenges.

My attitude towards this project is based on how it could look like in an ideal world where I knew everything about making an app. Then I have took the core part which I needed most and started there with what I already knew or at least had an idea how it may be done.

Doplnit info:
•	Jak nainstalovat a rozběhnout na vlastním stroji (detailní) - ideálně odkaz na web
•	Co udělat pro to, aby mohli rozšiřovat a pracovat na tom taky (pull, fork něco takového)
